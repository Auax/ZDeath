# ZDeath

## Battle-royale plugin

___
Basic CraftBukkit _battle royale_ plugin for Minecraft 1.20.1.

### Notes

This is a personalized project I decided to create to play in my custom server.
I decided to upload it to GitHub as I believe it is an interesting project,
that being said, it is in development and there is so much room for improvement.
This being a personal project means I might or might not update or improve it, but it does work, and it can
help as a foundation for other users.

### Permissions

You can manage it with _LuckyPerms_.

And more...
